====================
Contributing to SOCS
====================

Branches
--------

There are two long-lived branches in SOCS, ``master`` and ``develop``.
``master`` should be considered stable, and will only move forward on official
releases. ``develop`` may be unstable, and is where all development should take
place. This branching model follows the one in the OCS_ repository.

What this means for you, the contributor, is that you should base your feature
branches off of the latest ``develop`` branch, and pull request them into
``develop``. Detailed steps below.

Pull Requests
-------------

When opening a pull request, you should push your feature branch, and select
the ``develop`` branch as the base branch, the branch you want to merge your
feature branch into. This is the default branch, so it should be automatically
selected for you.

Releases
--------

    **Note:** Releases will be issued by core maintainers of SOCS.

If you are trying to issue a release of SOCS you should follow these steps:

1. Open a Pull Request, comparing ``develop`` to the ``master`` base branch.
   Describe the features added for this release.
2. Make a merge commit when you merge this PR.

   * This merge commit will be what is tagged for the release.
   * ``develop`` is now one commit behind ``master`` (the merge commit)

3. Pull the latest ``master`` and ``develop`` branches to your work station.
4. Checkout ``develop``, then run ``git merge --ff-only master``, catching ``develop`` up to ``master``.
5. ``push origin develop`` to update the remote ``develop`` branch.

The ``develop`` and ``master`` branches are now aligned, and ``master`` is
ready to be released. You can use the GitHub release interface to create a new
release, copying the change log you wrote in the PR and otherwise describing the
release.
