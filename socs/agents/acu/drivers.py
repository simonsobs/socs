        el_endpoint2 (float): second elevation endpoint of the scan. For
            constant az scans, this must be equal to el_endpoint1.
        el_speed (float): speed of the elevation motion. For constant az
            scans, set to 0.0
        num_batches (int or None): sets the number of batches for the
            generator to create. Default value is None (interpreted as infinite
            batches).
        num_scans (int or None): if not None, limits the points
          returned to the specified number of constant velocity legs.
        start_time (float or None): a ctime at which to start the scan.
            Default is None, which is interpreted as starting now +
            wait_to_start.
        wait_to_start (float): number of seconds to wait between
            start_time and when the scan actually starts. Default is 10 seconds.
        step_time (float): time between points on the constant-velocity
            parts of the motion. Default value is 1.0 seconds. Minimum value is
            0.05 seconds.
        batch_size (int): number of values to produce in each iteration.
            Default is 500. Batch size is reset to the length of one leg of the
            motion if num_batches is not None.
        az_start (str): part of the scan to start at.  To start at one
            of the extremes, use 'az_endpoint1', 'az_endpoint2', or
            'end' (same as 'az_endpoint1').  To start in the midpoint

            positive az velocity), 'mid_dec' (negative az velocity),
            or 'mid' (velocity oriented towards endpoint2).
        az_first_pos (float): If not None, the first az scan will
            start at this position (but otherwise proceed in the same
            starting direction).
        ptstack_fmt (bool): determine whether values are produced with the

            produce lists of time, azimuth, elevation, azimuth velocity,

    acceleration.

    These get complicated in the limit of high velocity and narrow
    scan.

    Returns:

      A dict with outputs of the calculations.  The following items
      must be considered when generating and posting the track points:

      - 'step_time': The recommended track point separation, in
        seconds.
      - 'wait_to_start': The minimum time (s) between initiating
        ProgramTrack mode and the first uploaded point's timestamp.
      - 'init_az': The az (deg) at which to position the telescope
        before beginning the scan.  This takes into account any "ramp
        up" that needs to occur and the fact that such ramp up needs
        to be finished before the ACU starts profiling the first
        turn-around.

      The following dict items provide additional detail /
      intermediate results:

      - 'scan_start_buffer': Minimum amount (deg of az) by which to
        shift the start of the first scan leg in order to satisfy the
        requirements for az_prep and az_rampup.  This ultimately is
        what can make init_az different from the natural first leg
        starting point.  This parameter is always non-negative.
      - 'turnprep_buffer': Minimum azimuth travel required for
        ProgramTrack to prepare a turn-around.
      - 'rampup_buffer': Minimum azimuth travel required for
        ProgramTrack to ramp up to the first leg velocity.  Degrees,
        positive.
      - 'rampup_time': Number of seconds before the first track point
        where the platform could start moving (as part of smooth
        acceleration into the initial velocity).
