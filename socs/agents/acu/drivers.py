def from_file(filename, fmt=None):
    """Load a ProgramTrack trajectory from a file.  This function
    supports two formats. The modern format is a pickle file. The
    older numpy format is also supported.

    Parameters:
      filename (str): Full path to the file.
      fmt (str): Optional, one of "pickle" or "numpy". If this is
        unspecified, the code will assume pickle format unless the
        filename ends in "npy".

    Returns:
      FromFileScan: Object containing the loaded points and
        supporting config for ProgramTrack mode.

    Notes:

      For the pickle-based file format, the file must encode a
      single dict. Here is a minimal example::

        {
         'timestamp': [1747233498, 1747233499, ..., 1747233523],
         'az': [180, 181, ..., 160],
         'el': [60, 60, ..., 60],
        }

      Those 3 required entries are "vectors", with the same
      length. The vectors may be any iterable type but please use
      lists or ndarrays. Optionally, the user may specify these other
      vectors:

        - 'az_vel': the az velocity at each point.
        - 'el_vel': the el velocity at each point.
        - 'az_flag': the az flag.
        - 'el_flag': the el flag.
        - 'group_flag': the point grouping flag.

      If not provided, the "vel" vectors will be computed from the
      gradient of the position vectors.  The "flag" vectors will
      default to all 0.  See :class:`TrackPoint
      <socs.agents.acu.drivers.TrackPoint>` for purpose of the various
      flags.

      The following settings (stated with their default values) may
      also be included in the dict:

        - 'free_form' (bool, False): Specifies whether the track
          should be run with the turn-around profiler disabled and
          spline (rather than linear) interpolation enabled. When
          false, the ACU will do linear interpolation *and* automatic
          profiling of turn-arounds, between constant velocity
          segments. Setting free_form=False is appropriate for
          constant elevation, constant az speed scans.  Set
          free_form=True for more complex scans.
        - 'loopable' (bool, False): Specifies whether the track should
          be repeated, forever.  When this is the case, the final
          point of the track (i.e. the last point in all the vectors)
          is ignored *except for the timestamp*, which is used to set
          the time at which the next loop iteration is started.
        - 'preamble_count' (int, 0): If loopable, this specifies the
          number of points in the track (i.e. in each vector) that are
          not included in the loopable portion.  This permits the
          track to have a ramp-up, or partial initial scan segment,
          prior to entering the repetable template.

      The older numpy-based format does not support the additional
      settings.  The numpy file must contain an iterable with 5 or 7
      entries, where all entries are 1-d arrays of the same length.
      The first 5 arrays will correspond to 'timestamp', 'az', 'el',
      'az_vel', 'el_vel'.  The 2 optional arrays are 'az_flag' and
      'el_flag'.

        el_endpoint2 (float): second elevation endpoint of the scan. For
            constant az scans, this must be equal to el_endpoint1.
        el_speed (float): speed of the elevation motion. For constant az
            scans, set to 0.0
        num_batches (int or None): sets the number of batches for the
            generator to create. Default value is None (interpreted as infinite
            batches).
        num_scans (int or None): if not None, limits the points

        start_time (float or None): a ctime at which to start the scan.
            Default is None, which is interpreted as starting now +
            wait_to_start.
        wait_to_start (float): number of seconds to wait between
            start_time and when the scan actually starts. Default is 10 seconds.
        step_time (float): time between points on the constant-velocity
            parts of the motion. Default value is 1.0 seconds. Minimum value is
            0.05 seconds.
        batch_size (int): number of values to produce in each iteration.
            Default is 500. Batch size is reset to the length of one leg of the
            motion if num_batches is not None.
        az_start (str): part of the scan to start at.  To start at one
            of the extremes, use 'az_endpoint1', 'az_endpoint2', or
            'end' (same as 'az_endpoint1').  To start in the midpoint

            positive az velocity), 'mid_dec' (negative az velocity),
            or 'mid' (velocity oriented towards endpoint2).
        az_first_pos (float): If not None, the first az scan will
            start at this position (but otherwise proceed in the same
            starting direction).
        az_drift (float): The rate (deg / s) at which to shift the

    scan with the desired end points, velocity, and mean turn-around
    acceleration.

    These get complicated in the limit of high velocity and narrow
    scan.

    Returns:

      A dict with outputs of the calculations.  The following items
      must be considered when generating and posting the track points:

      - 'step_time': The recommended track point separation, in
        seconds.
      - 'wait_to_start': The minimum time (s) between initiating
        ProgramTrack mode and the first uploaded point's timestamp.
      - 'init_az': The az (deg) at which to position the telescope
        before beginning the scan.  This takes into account any "ramp
        up" that needs to occur and the fact that such ramp up needs
        to be finished before the ACU starts profiling the first
        turn-around.

      The following dict items provide additional detail /
      intermediate results:

      - 'scan_start_buffer': Minimum amount (deg of az) by which to
        shift the start of the first scan leg in order to satisfy the
        requirements for az_prep and az_rampup.  This ultimately is
        what can make init_az different from the natural first leg
        starting point.  This parameter is always non-negative.
      - 'turnprep_buffer': Minimum azimuth travel required for
        ProgramTrack to prepare a turn-around.
      - 'rampup_buffer': Minimum azimuth travel required for
        ProgramTrack to ramp up to the first leg velocity.  Degrees,
        positive.
      - 'rampup_time': Number of seconds before the first track point
        where the platform could start moving (as part of smooth
        acceleration into the initial velocity).
