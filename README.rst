Overview
--------

This repository, `SOCS`_, contains hardware control code for the
Simons Observatory.  This code operates within the framework provided
by `OCS`_.  People who liked OCS and SOCS also liked `Sisock`_, our
time-domain data query system with grafana integration.

Installation
------------

This code can be used directly from the source tree.

In order for OCS tools to find these agents, you must add the full
path to the agents directory, e.g. ``/home/simons/code/socs/agents/``,
to your OCS site config file. Do so by adding the following under your
configured host if it does not already exist:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # List of additional paths to Agent plugin modules.
  'agent-paths': [
    '/path/to/socs/agents/',
  ],

See the `ocs docs`_ for more details.
