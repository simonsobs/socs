Overview
--------

This repository, `SOCS`_, contains hardware control code for the
Simons Observatory.  This code operates within the framework provided
by `OCS`_.

.. _`OCS`: https://github.com/simonsobs/ocs/
.. _SOCS: https://github.com/simonsobs/socs/

Installation
------------

Install and update with pip::

    $ pip3 install -U socs

You may install optional dependencies by including one or more agent group
names on installation, for example::

    $ pip3 install -U socs[labjack,synacc]

For a complete list of agent groups see the `Installation Documentation`_.

If you would like to install all optional dependencies use the special varient
"all"::

    $ pip3 install -U socs[all]

**Note:** Not all optional dependencies can be installed this way. See the
`Installation Documentation`_ for more info on specific agent dependencies.

.. _`Installation Documentation`: https://socs.readthedocs.io/en/main/user/installation.html

Installing from Source
``````````````````````

If you are considering contributing to SOCS, or would like to use an unreleased
feature, you will want to install from source. To do so, clone this repository
and install using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/simonsobs/socs.git
    cd socs/
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    pip3 install .

In order for OCS tools to find these agents, you must add the full
path to the agents directory, e.g. ``/home/simons/code/socs/agents/``,
to your OCS site config file. Do so by adding the following under your
configured host if it does not already exist:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # List of additional paths to Agent plugin modules.
  'agent-paths': [
    '/path/to/socs/agents/',
  ],

See the `ocs docs`_ for more details.

.. _`ocs docs`: https://ocs.readthedocs.io/en/main/developer/site_config.html

Docker Images
-------------
Docker images for SOCS and each Agent are available on `Docker Hub`_. Official
releases will be tagged with their release version, i.e. ``v0.1.0``. These are
only built on release, and the ``latest`` tag will point to the latest of these
released tags. These should be considered stable.

Test images will be tagged with the latest released version tag, the number of
commits ahead of that release, the latest commit hash, i.e.
``v0.0.2-81-g9c10ba6-dev``. These get built on each commit to the ``main``
branch, and are useful for testing and development, but should be considered
unstable.

.. _Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/u/simonsobs

Documentation
-------------
The SOCS documentation can be built using Sphinx. There is a separate
``requirements.txt`` file in the ``docs/`` directory to install Sphinx and any
additional documentation dependencies::

  cd docs/
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  make html

You can then open ``docs/_build/html/index.html`` in your preferred web
browser. You can also find a copy hosted on `Read the Docs`_.

.. _Read the Docs: https://socs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Tests
-----
The tests for SOCS are run using pytest, and should be run from the
``tests/`` directory::

  $ cd tests/
  $ python3 -m pytest --cov

For more details see `tests/README.rst <tests_>`_.
