Simons Observatory Control System
=================================

The Simons Observatory Control System (SOCS) repository contains SO specific
OCS code. This includes OCS Agents designed for interfacing with SO specific
hardware, as well as SO specific configuration recommendations. For information
about general OCS components, see the `OCS Documentation
<https://ocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_.

Agent Reference      Agents are the OCS components that interface with other
                     systems. These run at all times, awaiting commands from
                     OCS Clients. These are the Agents specifc to SO hardware.
Simulator Reference  Simulators are used to mock software and hardware
                     interfaces when access to actual hardware is unavailable.
                     These are useful for testing other code.
