Introduction
============

The Simons Observatory Control System (`SOCS`_) library contains
Observatory Control System (`OCS`_) Agents for hardware being used by the
Simons Observatory.

Users of SOCS should first confirm that OCS is set up and running
correctly. Then SOCS Agents can be integrated into the system.

General usage of OCS is covered in the `documentation for OCS`_, including
`network configuration`_ and `creating new agents`_.

In this documentation, we first describe how to obtain the SOCS code and enable
SOCS Agents for use with OCS. Then we provide descriptions of each Agent and
hardware simulator. We conclude with a brief devleoper guide for SOCS library
code.
