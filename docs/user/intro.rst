Introduction
============

The Simons Observatory Control System (`SOCS`_) codebase contains
device control code for use with the base Observatory Control System
(`OCS`_).

Users of SOCS should first confirm that OCS is set up and running
correctly.  Then device codes from SOCS can be integrated into the
system.

General usage of OCS is covered in the `documentation for OCS`_.  In
the present documentation, we first focus on how to obtain the SOCS
code and enable SOCS Agent scripts for use with OCS.  Then we provide
descriptions of each hardware module.
