Installation
============

Install and update with pip::

    $ pip install -U socs

Optionally install so3g during installation::

    $ pip install -U socs[so3g]

Installing from Source
----------------------

To install from source, clone the respository and install with pip::

    git clone https://github.com/simonsobs/socs.git
    cd socs/
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    pip3 install .

.. note::
    If you are expecting to develop socs code you should consider using
    the `-e` flag.

.. note::
    If you would like to install for just the local user, throw the `--user`
    flag when running `setup.py`.

The SOCS Agents are kept in the ``agents/`` sub-directory of the
repository.  Take note of the full path to the ``agents`` directory,
as you will need to add it to the OCS site configuration file.

In some systems it may be advantageous to copy the scripts to a stable
deployment location, outside the source tree
(e.g. ``/usr/local/lib/socs``).  Currently SOCS does not provide any
installation script to assist with this, but ``cp -r`` will work.

To make the Agent scripts usable within OCS, you must:

- Ensure that any package dependencies for Agent scripts
  are satisfied.  Note that you only need to install the dependencies
  for the specific Agents that you intend to run on the local system.
- Edit the local system's site config file to include the full path to
  the SOCS agents directory.


Site Config File
----------------

A configured OCS host will contain a site config file (SCF), which describes
how to connect to the crossbar server as well as which Agents will run on the
system.

To tell OCS about the SOCS agents, update the ``agent-paths`` setting
in the host configuration block for your host.  The ``agent-paths``
setting is a list of paths on the local system, which should already
include the path to the base OCS installations agents.  With that path
included, you should then be able to add agent instance entries that
refer to Agent classes defined in SOCS.

In the example below, we assume that the local hostname is
``special-host-1``.  The path to ``/usr/shared/lib/socs/agents`` has
been added to the ``agent-paths`` variable, and a new Agent instance
for the Lakeshore372 has been added to ``agent-instances`` list.  Note
that ... is a place-holder for other configuration text.

        ...
        {'agent-class': 'Lakeshore372Agent',
         'instance-id': 'thermo1',
         'arguments': [['--serial-number', 'LSA21YC'],
                       ['--ip-address', '10.10.10.2']]},
        ...
      ]
      ...
    }
